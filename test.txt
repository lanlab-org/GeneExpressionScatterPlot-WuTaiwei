Test title: test case for requirement 1

Desription: The user chooses to upload the data file to the main page. If the data is wrong, an error message will be displayed, requesting the user to upload again. Otherwise, a scatter plot will be generated after running.

Rationale: In a visual user interface, users can quickly analyze gene correlation after uploading data files.

Input:
g1.json: N10_n1_S10_info_miss_rate0.00_g1.json
g2.json: N10_n1_S10_info_miss_rate0.00_g2.json
info.json: N10_n1_S10_info_miss_rate0.00_info.json

Expect output: these files can be upload and scatter plot can be displayed successfully.
